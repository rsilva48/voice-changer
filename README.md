## Overview

This is a fork of [Tg Develop's voice changer](https://github.com/tg-develop/voice-changer) that performs real-time voice conversion
using various voice conversion algorithms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version works only with Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC).

The fork aims to improve the overall performance for any backend, and at the same time introducing new features and improving
user experience.

## Supported operated systems

* Windows 10 or later.
* Linux.
* macOS 12 Monterey or later. With Apple Silicon or Intel CPU.

## System requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum requirement means that you will be able to run **ONLY** the voice changer. Voice conversion and gaming at the same time will not provide satisfying experience with minimum requirements in most cases.

RAM: at least 6GB.

Disk space: at least 6GB of free disk space. For fast model loading, SSD is recommended.

### For CPU-only voice conversion

Minimum requirement: Intel Core i5-4690K or AMD FX-6300.

Recommended requirement: Intel Core i5-10400F or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X.

### For GPU voice conversion

Minimum VRAM required: 2GB (in FP32 mode), ~1GB (in FP16 mode, if supported).

Minimum requirement:

* An integrated graphics card: AMD Radeon Vega 7 (with AMD Ryzen 5 5600G) or later.
* A dedicated graphics card: Nvidia GeForce GTX 900 Series or later, or AMD Radeon RX 400 series or later, or Intel Arc A300 series or later.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to use Nvidia GeForce GTX 700 series GPUs. However, they can be used only with DirectML version.

> [!WARNING]
> The voice changer does not perform well with integrated Intel GPUs. This is a known issue that may be addressed in the future. You may proceed at your own risk and report issues or successful usage.

Recommended requirement:

A dedicated graphics card Nvidia GeForce RTX 20 Series or later, or AMD Radeon RX 6000 series or later, or Intel Arc A500 series or later.

> [!NOTE]
> **AMD ROCm Windows** (native GPU acceleration via PyTorch ROCm) is supported for AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000 and RX 9000 series (RDNA2, RDNA3, RDNA4). This requires **Python 3.12** and AMD Adrenalin Edition driver **26.1.1 or later**. See [For AMD ROCm users (RX 6000/7000/9000)](#for-amd-rocm-users-rx-600070009000) for setup instructions.

## Known issues

### General

* Mozilla Firefox ESR may not display audio devices.

### DirectML (dml) version

* When changing **Chunk**, **Extra** or **Crossfade size** settings, you must switch device to CPU then back to your GPU.
  Otherwise, performance issues can be observed.

* Only `rmvpe_onnx`, `fcpe_onnx`, `crepe_tiny_onnx` and `crepe_full_onnx` are available in the list of **F0 Det.**.

* When using a laptop with integrated GPU and dedicated GPU, severely degraded performance (up to 50% reduction) can be observed when running the voice changer on built-in display.

* Slightly degraded performance (up to 25% reduction) can be observed with multi-GPU setups.

* AMD Radeon RX 7000 series may be unable to achieve low latency (below 256ms).

### AMD ROCm Windows version

* PyTorch `.pth` models run on the GPU via ROCm/HIP. ONNX models (e.g. `rmvpe_onnx`, `fcpe_onnx`, ONNX inferencers) run on the **CPU** because DirectML is unstable on RDNA3/RDNA4 GPUs under the current ONNX Runtime version. Performance is still significantly better than full CPU mode.

* Only non-ONNX pitch extractors (`rmvpe`, `fcpe`, `crepe_tiny`, `crepe_full`) fully utilize the GPU. The `_onnx` variants fall back to CPU.

* Requires **Python 3.12** installed via the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installer (not from the Microsoft Store).

* Requires AMD Adrenalin Edition driver **26.1.1 or later**.

### Nvidia version

* When starting voice conversion for the first time, it may take up to 5-7 seconds to start outputting the converted voice.

### All versions

* Only "perf" metric is reported in server audio mode with `rest` protocol.

## How to use

### Running locally on Windows

#### Running the voice changer

1. Open the extracted folder (`voice-changer-windows-amd64-dml` or `voice-changer-windows-amd64-cuda`) > `MMVCServerSIO`.

1. Run `MMVCServerSIO.exe`.

When running the voice changer for the first time, it will start downloading necessary files. Do not close the window until the download finishes.

Once the download is finished, the voice changer will open the user interface using your default web browser.

### Running locally on macOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> macOS support is experimental.

#### For Apple Silicon (Apple M1, etc.) users

1. Download the `voice-changer-macos-arm64-cpu.tar.gz` file.

1. Double-click the file. The voice changer will unpack and the `MMVCServerSIO` folder will appear.

#### For Intel users

> [!NOTE]
> The voice changer would work best if your Intel-based machine has AMD graphics. If your machine has only Intel integrated graphics, only CPU will be utilized.

1. Download the `voice-changer-macos-amd64-cpu.tar.gz` file.

1. Double-click the file. The voice changer will unpack and the `MMVCServerSIO` folder will appear.

#### Removing Apple quarantine attribute

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, this step is mandatory. Otherwise, the voice changer will fail to start with an error related to **Python.framework** being damaged. This may be improved in the future.

1. Open Terminal.

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <Path to extracted MMVCServerSIO folder>
   ```

   For example, if you extracted the voice changer to your desktop, the command may look as follows:

   ```
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Desktop/MMVCServerSIO
   ```

#### Running the voice changer

1. Open the extracted `MMVCServerSIO` folder.

1. Double-click `MMVCServerSIO` to run the voice changer.

### Running locally on Linux

> [!NOTE]
> Tested on Arch Linux (CachyOS) with PipeWire. For a complete reference including ROCm setup, audio troubleshooting and advanced routing, see [docs/linux-setup.md](docs/linux-setup.md).

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.10, PortAudio and snd-aloop:

   **Arch / Manjaro:**
   ```
   sudo pacman -S python python-pip portaudio alsa-utils pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
   ```

   **Ubuntu / Debian:**
   ```
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv portaudio19-dev alsa-utils
   ```

1. Load the kernel loopback module (acts as virtual audio cable):

   ```
   sudo modprobe snd-aloop
   ```

   To make it permanent across reboots:

   ```
   echo "snd-aloop" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/snd-aloop.conf
   ```

#### Installation

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` folder.

1. Run the installation script:

   ```
   chmod u+x ./vc_install.sh
   ./vc_install.sh
   ```

   Select the backend that matches your GPU: `CPU`, `CUDA` (Nvidia), or `ROCm` (AMD).

   > [!NOTE]
   > For ROCm on unsupported GPUs (e.g. RDNA4/gfx1201), add `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=12.0.0` to your environment before starting. See [docs/linux-setup.md](docs/linux-setup.md) for details.

#### Running the voice changer

1. Start the server:

   ```
   chmod u+x ./vc_startup.sh
   ./vc_startup.sh
   ```

1. Open `http://localhost:18888` in your browser.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The browser does not open automatically on Linux. Copy the address from the terminal.

1. In the voice changer UI, set the audio devices:

   | Setting | Recommended value |
   |---------|------------------|
   | Input device | `pipewire` |
   | Output device | `pulse` |
   | Monitor device | *(leave disabled)* |
   | Sample rate | `48000` |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do **not** select `hw:X,Y`, `plughw:X,Y` or `default` as devices under PipeWire. These bypass PipeWire's ownership of the hardware and cause an immediate crash (SIGABRT). Always use `pipewire` or `pulse`.

#### Routing to Discord / OBS

The startup script automatically creates a source called **RVC-Microphone** from the loopback device. In Discord or OBS, select **RVC-Microphone** as the input device.

> [!NOTE]
> Discord and OBS do not show PipeWire monitor sources in their device lists. The script works around this by wrapping the loopback monitor in a named source using `pactl load-module module-remap-source`. The source is removed automatically when the server is stopped.

### Running on Colab/Kaggle

Refer to corresponding [Colab](https://github.com/tg-develop/voice-changer/blob/master-custom/Colab_RealtimeVoiceChanger.ipynb) or [Kaggle](https://github.com/tg-develop/voice-changer/blob/master-custom/Kaggle_RealtimeVoiceChanger.ipynb) notebooks in this repository and follow their instructions.

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> When any issue with the voice changer occurs, check the command line window (the one that opens during the start) for errors.

### Exceptions.PretrainDownloadException: 'Failed to download weight.'

Either the remote files have changed or your files were corrupted. The error will show which files are affected above the error:

```
[WeightDownloader] 'pretrain/content_vec_500.onnx failed to pass hash verification check. Got 1931e237626b80d65ae44cbacd4a5197, expected ab288ca5b540a4a15909a40edf875d1e'
[WeightDownloader] 'pretrain/rmvpe.onnx failed to pass hash verification check. Got 65030149d579a65f15aa7e85769c32f1, expected b6979bf69503f8ec48c135000028a7b0'
```

Find and delete the mentioned files from the voice changer folder and restart the voice changer. Deleted files will be re-downloaded.

### Audio devices are not displayed

1. Make sure that you have given the permission to access the microphone.

1. If you are using Mozilla Firefox ESR, there may be an issue with audio devices. Use other web browser (preferably Chrome or Chromium-based).

### No sound after start

1. Make sure you have selected correct input and output audio devices.

1. Make sure your input device is not muted. Check the microphone volume in the system settings or hardware switch on your headset (usually a button, if present).

### Hearing non-converted voice

In the voice changer, make sure **passthru** is not on (indicated by yellow "Passthrough On" button). Click it to switch it off.

### Hearing audio crackles

1. Make sure you are using **VAC by Muzychenko** (indicated by the **Line 1** audio device name).

1. In Windows **Sound Control Panel**, make sure that the sample rate of your microphone matches the sample rate of the virtual cable.

   The following example shows the configuration of the virtual cable and the microphone:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd19dcbe-87a8-4e0a-9d3d-baf8015c546c)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7ae533-3ba5-4308-895e-54254c2a67e0)

1. If nothing helped, in **Task Manager** > **Details**, find "audiodg.exe" process and do the folowing:

   1. Right-click "audiodg.exe" > **Set priority** > **High**.
  
   1. Right-click "audiodg.exe" > **Set affinity**. Uncheck every option, then only select CPU 2.

### Audio is stuttery

1. If you changed chunk when voice conversion was on, click **Stop** then **Start** again.

1. Make sure the **perf** time is smaller than **Chunk**. Increase **Chunk** or reduce **Extra** and **Crossfade size**.

### Linux: server crashes immediately on start (SIGABRT)

You selected a `hw:X,Y`, `plughw:X,Y` or `default` device. These access hardware directly and conflict with PipeWire's exclusive ownership. Select `pipewire` or `pulse` as input/output devices instead.

### Linux: RVC-Microphone not appearing in Discord

1. Check that `snd-aloop` is loaded: `lsmod | grep snd_aloop`. If missing, run `sudo modprobe snd-aloop`.

1. Restart the server. The startup script loads the `RVC-Microphone` source each time it starts.

1. In Discord go to **Settings → Voice & Video → Input Device** and select **RVC-Microphone**.

### Linux: ALSA underrun errors in the log

The server sample rate does not match the hardware rate. Set all four sample rate fields (`serverInputAudioSampleRate`, `serverOutputAudioSampleRate`, `serverMonitorAudioSampleRate`, `serverAudioSampleRate`) to `48000` (or to `44100` if your device does not support 48 kHz).

## Contribution

At the moment, the fork does not accept any code contributions. However, feel free to report any issues
you encounter during usage.

## Working with the source

### Prerequisites

1. [If not installed] Download and install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/) (for CPU, CUDA and DirectML backends).

   > [!NOTE]
   > **AMD ROCm Windows** requires **Python 3.12** instead. Download and install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/) from the official Python website (not the Microsoft Store).

1. [If not installed] Download and install git.

1. Open a command line.

1. Verify your Python version by running the following command:

   ```
   python --version
   Python 3.10.8
   ```

   For ROCm Windows, verify Python 3.12 is accessible via the launcher:

   ```
   py -3.12 --version
   Python 3.12.10
   ```

1. Clone the repository.

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.

### Setting up the environment

Run the installation script and choose your architecture:

   * For Windows:

     ```
     .\vc_install.bat
     ```

     Available options:
     - `1` — CPU only
     - `2` — Nvidia CUDA
     - `3` — DirectML (AMD/Intel GPU, Windows)
     - `4` — ROCm (AMD GPU, Linux)
     - `5` — ROCm for Windows (AMD RX 6000/7000/9000 — requires Python 3.12)

   * For Linux:

     ```
     chmod u+x ./vc_install.sh
     ./vc_install.sh
     ```

### Running the server

Run the startup script for the server:

   * For Windows:

     ```
     .\vc_startup.bat
     ```

   * For Linux:

     ```
     chmod u+x ./vc_startup.sh
     ./vc_start.sh
     ```

This will run the server with default settings. Note that it will not open the web browser by default, copy the address from command line.

### Building a package

1. [If not installed] Install `pyinstaller` with the following command:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools pyinstaller
   ```

1. Run the following command to build an executable:

   ```
   pyinstaller --clean -y --dist ./dist --workpath /tmp MMVCServerSIO.spec
   ```

   This will output the resulting executable in the `dist` folder.
